# Physics67

Welcome to the repository for the class modules for Physics 67: Introduction to laboratory physics.

Each week you will be working through 1-3 notebooks during the lab time, and then spending some additional time writing up a short report on what youd did.

The github repository contains the notebooks that you will be using, as well as the data a figures that you will need to run those notebooks.
