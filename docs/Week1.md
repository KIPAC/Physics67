## Measurements and simple statistics

This week we are going to be discussing the idea of what it means to make a measurement, practice a bit with using notebooks, make a few graphs and to explore some simple statistics, and how they relate to making measurements.

The statistics we will be covering are the mean, median, mode, standard deviation and standard error of a distribution.

These topics are covered in chapters 1 and 2 of: "Measurements and Their Uncertainties : A Practical Guide to Modern Error Analysis" which is available online via the Stanford bookstore.  You don't need to read those chapters, but you may find them a useful reference, and they present the material in a somewhat different way than we will be presenting it, which you might find more intuitive.
