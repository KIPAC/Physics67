## Data analysis topics

This week we are going to be discussing how to combine measurements.

The statistical techniques that we will cover are weighted
means and error propagation.


## Scientific context and resources

We are going to be continuing to work with the set of
measurements of the Hubble constant.


## Python functions reference

| Function Name            | What it does |
| - | - |
| numpy.var                | Compute the variance of the values in an array |
| numpy.random.normal      | Generate random numbers from a normal or 'Gaussian' distribution |
| array.size               | return the number of elements in an array |
| array.shape              | return the shape of an array, i.e., arrays can have more that one dimension and this function tells you  the shape of the array.  The size of the array is the product of the size of all the axes of the array |
| plt.legend               | Attach a legend to a figure |

<!--  LocalWords:  numpy.var plt.imshow plt.colorbar plt.legend
 -->
