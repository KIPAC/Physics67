# Follow up notes for week 8.

### Frequency and wave number

Last week we worked with analyzing data using Fourier analysis.

In the first notebook we worked with audio files and looked at the frequencies that were
present is a few music clips.

In the second notebook we worked with some  data from Ben's lab studying the behavior of
electrons on a copper surface.  Basically, this introduced two new concepts.

	1.  We can apply Fourier analysis to spatial data as well as time data.  I.e., with music, the frequency of the
	variation of the sound wave with time is what our ears hear as the pitch of  the music.  It turns out that the
	spatial frequency of variation of the electron density with distance is released to the momentum and energy
	levels of the electrons.

	2. We can apply Fourier analysis in more that one dimension.  I.e., we can study wave on surfaces, or even waves
	in solid materials.

Let's see if we can break those two concept down into pieces.

One of the figures we had showed waves that were oriented diagonally.

The bright bits might be places where the wave is higher, the dark bits where it is lower.

The first concept we have is wave number.  it is basically the spatial equivalent of frequency.  I.e., it is the number
of waves that you can fit into a fixed length.   Since the image above is 1m X 1m it is really easy to count how many
wave can fit in a meter.  I count 10 waves along the x-axis and 5 waves along the y-axis.

The second concept is describing the wave in more that one dimension.  But we have already basically done that.
I.e., the wave numbers are 5 and 10, so we can combine them to get a wave vector, which is (5, 10).

We had a figure that looked like this:

The reason that there are two points instead of just 1 is that we just as easily count have counted in other other directions,
e.g., left-to-right instead of right-to-left.
