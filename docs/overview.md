## Course Overview

Normally, in this course you would be doing simple lab experiments related to the material in physics 65 and writing up lab reports.

However, because of the pandemic and the uncertainty meeting in person we have decided to try something new.  We are taking this opportunity to modernize the course and to make it more like what you would be doing if you did summer research with one of the research groups on campus or at SLAC.

We are going to focus on data and data analysis, and on getting you comfortable using modern software to do the data analysis.  The goal is to teach you what you would learn in the first few weeks of doing a summer research programs, while also covering topics related to the material in physics 65.


### Lab Sessions

This class will meet for 10 weeks.  Each week we will meet for an 80 minute online class session.  You will spend most of the time in those session working through some data analysis exercises in the form of Jupyter notebooks.  The notebooks include a number of questions.  Your assignement will be to answer those questions in a short "lab report".  You will have the choice to either finish the lab reports after class, or to hand them in at any time in the week after the class. 

The class breakdown will look something like this:

	- First 10-20 minutes (longer the first week):  single zoom room
	  - Some comments about the context of the weeks excersices from the instructors.  This will include:
		- Data analysis context: what techniques we wil be learning that week.
		- Scientific context: some information about the datasets we will be using.
	- Remainder of class session: breakout rooms
	  - Working though the notebooks
	  - Discussing your findings with your group
	  - Option to go back to main room to ask questions, take a break and chat with other students or the instructors.
	  - The zoom room will stay open and be staffed by at least one instructor for about an hour after the official class time ends
		- This is an opportunity for you do work on the lab reports.


### Final project / presentation

The last two weeks of the class will be devoted to working on an presenting a short (2 or 3 slide) presentation following up on some data analysis
from one of the topics that we covered in the course.

Week 9 will be a chance to work on the data analysis and start to organize your slides.  Week 10 will be devoted to student presentations.
