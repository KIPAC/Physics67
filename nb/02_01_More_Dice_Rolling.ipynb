    "\n",
    "1. To review the concept of weighted averages.\n",
    "2. To understand when it makes sense to use weighted averages. \n",
    "3. To understand how histograms and wieghted averages are tools that can be used to summarize large data sets a much smaller set of numbers.\n",

    "### Timing\n",

    "1. Try to finish this notebook in 30-35 minutes\n",
